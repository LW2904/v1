  "If you died, would anyone care?</br>Would they really care?</br>Maybe, they'd cry for a day.</br>But let's be honest, no one would give a shit. They wouldn't.</br>The few people that would feel obliged to go to your funeral would probably be annoyed and leave as early as possible.</br>That's who you are.</br>That's what you are.</br>You're nothing to anyone. To everyone.",
  "I avoid myself.</br>Why?</br>I'm afraid.</br>Finding too much. Too little. Nothing at all.</br>Do I even exist?",
  "We live in a kingdom of bullshit.",
  "I'm just anonymous.</br>I'm just alone.",
  "A bug is never just a mistake. It represents something bigger.</br>An error of thinking that makes you who you are.",
  "I wanted to save the world.",
  "Give a man a gun, he'll rob a bank.</br>Give a man a bank, he'll rob the world.",
  "We’re all living in each other’s paranoia.</br>You definitely can’t argue that.</br>Is that why everyone tries to avoid each other?",
  "Believe what you want.</br>But neither you nor I are special."
