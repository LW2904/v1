Nothing in steam forbids anyone from wearing what ever they want. ethics aside. I have told many of you this before.. It could be looked at sort of flattery.And frankly, that was the case with the fake BLS tag.. In fact, I spoke with him and it is clear he adores BLS and all of you. Hindsight, I should not have posted that here and just dealt with it instead.I take full responsibilty for the confusion. Earlier I was also talking about a \"real imposter\"-a profile imposter,-two of them actually. That type of impersonating me and then acting like they are me, well is not right, criminal in my book. This is stealing someone's identity pure and simple.Therefore, ease up on someone wearing a fake BLS tag.. That is harmless. But you do have my permission to be as pissed as I am when someone steals a Steam profile identity.Sorry for getting everyone all riled up from not clearly distingushing the two earlier.
