The year was 1512 of the Far'Nir Calendar.

City of Ale'Xandria.

Many centuries ago, the aristocrats and nobilities that held the seat of influence here dubbed the city as the Crown Jewel of Luc'Valaria Empire. For them, the city mirrored everything that they were. It was the ultimate symbol of grandeur, power, and dominion just like them. But to the many commoners who had recognized Ale’Xandria as their one and only home, they endearingly call this place the City of Dreams. A place where anyone and everyone could make their star-filled aspirations come true. To the rest of the world, however, they simply know the city by its other popular name—the City of a Thousand Waterfalls.

It was no exaggeration to illustrate that all of Ale'Xandria, a city that played host to more than three million citizens was literally sitting on top of the grandest waterfall known to the continent. There was simply no other waterfalls anywhere else that was as majestic and as colossal as Ale’Xandria Falls.

Aside from the grand waterfalls, one of the biggest draws of the city and definitely a tourist favorite would have to be the view of the Grand Castle Avaricia--- the Heart of Ale'Xandria. It was named after the first and only female monarch to ever hold the most powerful seat in the empire in its entire history. Her name was Empress Avaricia Luc'Valaria the First.

Castle Avaricia, when viewed from the north, magnified an awe-inspiring spectacle that would easily captivate anyone’s heart. Why wouldn't it? The castle exuded romance, mysticism, and beauty. It was no secret, that the castle was intentionally erected right next to the edge of the waterfall in order to bring character to the edifice. The purpose was to evoke a feeling of both danger and mystery.

Countless visitors and tourist alike had already experienced profound emotions whenever they witness the beauty and madness that was Castle Avaricia.

"Is it ever going to fall over?"

Was a question frequently asked by everyone who had the privilege of witnessing the magnificence of the grand castle. Yes, it does appear like the castle might actually fall at any moment. It could fall now or it could fall later. We could only speculate. That being said, for those who had guessed that it might happen sooner than later, they might actually have to wait for a very long time to see that speculation come to fruition.

Uncannily, the entire structure of the castle was built so incredibly strong that it might take another millennium for it to actually fall. Castle Avaricia was intentionally built to last. This much was true. It was indeed sturdier than what it appeared to be. A thousand years had passed and yet, the castle stood firm against the test of both aging and nature. A true testament to the unrivaled Luc'Valarian engineering and architectural prowess.

It has been confirmed that the architecture of the Luc'Valaria Empire took generous inspiration from the old Tal'amasca as its influence. It wasn't only the aesthetics that the current generation adopted, they had also incorporated the sturdiness of the design that Tal’amasca architecture was known for. That was probably the most important piece of the mystery as to why the grand castle still stood until today.

The builders didn't stop there either. From creating spacious castles they moved to developing residential houses, shops, churches, citadels, and even brick-laden roads--- all were heavily influenced by the unparalleled Tal'amasca artistry. The lasting effect of the theme gave the city the sophisticated antiquarian charm added to its identity. Not to mention the allure of romanticism that everyone was so enamored of even until today.

The city architects also did a magnificent job dividing the city into four quick-to-access areas. The design was both simple and practical. There was the Residential District to the southwest; the Commercial District in the southeast; the Guilds Conglomerate to the far northeast; and finally, the Ale'Xandrian Army to the northwest. Even the monarchy had their own separate territory nestled further up north where Castle Avaricia was anchored at its center.

The careful placements of the districts gave the city order and a worrisome-free atmosphere. It was instrumental in transforming the place into something homely for the new explorers to easily navigate the area without getting lost. Thanks to that, Hezues fitted right in with no problem. Even though he was still a tad bit overwhelmed in terms of how imposing the city was especially with its sights and sounds. Nonetheless, he managed to pull right through.

‘This place is nothing like Tir’ad Pass.’ was something a small town skeleton in a big city would say. And it was. Tir’ad Pass truly paled in comparison against the mammoth that was Ale'Xandria. It was like comparing the entire territory of heaven to a tiny speck of dust. The contrast was so stark it was not even funny. 

Hezues checked his map once again. The tiny piece of parchment which was a document issued to him by the guild office of Tir’ad back when he was still there roughly four days ago. With him, aside from his map, was a recommendation letter from Officer Urbano. The content was basically detailing his completed registration and that he was qualified for the try-outs. It also included details such as his full name, height, weight, etc.

The supposed rendezvous point was formerly the Ivory Tower. However, with some last-minute changes, the organizers decided to have it moved to Ale’Xandria City instead. The decision to change it happened five days prior to the convergence date. The participants were to report at the makeshift registrar’s office located at the quadrangle of the Ale’Xandrian Army and convene there at 00:10:00 hours.

It was a little over seven in the morning and Hezues was just beginning to get acquainted with the cityscape. He flipped the map, tilting it upside down while wearing a worried frown underneath his mask.

'I think I'm lost.'

Admittedly, he was never good with directions even during his time in the dungeon. He would often just follow where his invisible master would need him to go and he would be there minutes later. He had an automatic compass back then which was very convenient. But now, he had lost that auto-feature and would definitely like to have that ‘navigation skill’ back (minus the whisper part of course) if he could.

With his horrible map sense, he actually ended up on the opposite side of where he intended to go. He was currently navigating the streets of the Commercial District with no particular aim than to get out of the area.

He wasn't sure though if it was a mere coincidence but somehow or something pulled him in towards this particular direction. He felt absent-minded and realized too late that he was already right in front of a café door. He was trying to twist the handle in fact.

"I'm so sorry mister but we're still closed." the helper in her chambermaid uniform pointed at the signage plastered across the glass door. --- The Spit Roast Cafe: Closed

"Pardon my intrusion. I didn't see the signage." Hezues replied out of embarrassment. He had somehow regained his senses. "Please don't mind the voice. Orc Shaman curse. Long story."

The moment he saw the maid’s reaction he quickly gave out the usual short excuse spiel for an immediate damage control. He realized now that he was no longer in Ti'rad pass and that the residents from around here doesn't have any idea as to who he was yet. So, it was only natural for them to be weirded out hearing him talk for the first time. The maids' confused expression was totally in his calculation.

"Would it be alright if I ask help for some directions instead?"

Hezues wanted to ask for the quickest way to the army fort and the maid was more than accommodating to help him with the map.

She showed him the gondola services location using the map about four blocks away. She even gave him the complete instruction with boarding and disembarking. Even the fees were given in details to him for free. Hezues bowed as he thanked the lady for her generosity. A debt he would want to repay someday. For now, he needed to move as quickly as possible.

Remembering the maid’s instruction, Hezues dove unhesitatingly into the crowded chaos when he exited the café area. The commercial district did not disappoint. He was immediately greeted by the amazing energy of the crowd when he turned around the bend.

The word that Hezues was looking for was ‘bustling’. The commercial district was without a doubt a place of convergence between many different types of adventurer’s from all walks of classes. Mages, Warriors, Healers, Blacksmiths, Battle Merchants, etc. You name a class and expect to find one without so much of a trouble.

Goods and wares were not the only commodities up for display at the marketplace. The adventurer’s, each wearing their own bloated egos, expensive wardrobes, equipment’s and steads, were intentionally displayed too. They were all like male peacocks, showing all their glorious feathers off in the hopes of striking a chance into enticing a female’s attention. The grander the spread, the better. And the Central Piazza was in no shortage of peacocks that morning. That bit was true.

Somehow, despite the many peacock’s elaborate displays, Hezues’s curiosity had been stolen by another point of display instead. He knew of the time constraint but he just couldn’t seem to resist the allure of the little gambling stand over at the corner of Latham Street. It drew a lot of the crowd’s attention already, including his.

The kid manning the stand was no more than four feet tall. His hair was mostly shaved off apart from the half an inch tall strip of hair left in the middle section of his crown. It was like a mohawk’s but a stripped down version of it. The kid was always wearing a smile from ear to ear. However, there was something uncomfortable with the boy’s smile. Hezues felt like those smiles never reached the boy’s eyes. The smile awkwardly felt heavy and forced. He wondered why that was but he could be wrong with his guesses too. He was a skeleton after all and would not consider himself the best judge of human character.

“Step right in and place your bets! This is going to be the last round before I pack up for today.”

The kid’s game was simple. There was a dice the size of a fist with numbers that were marked from one through six on each side. The kid would toss the dice inside of the tin bucket and would then shake it well right after. Once he slams the bucket on the ground, the participant’s job was to perfectly guess the number that the dice would reveal face up once the bucket was removed later. The gamblers would place their bets on the number that would hopefully correspond to the dice. They each have one in six chances to win. If they do manage to win, their money would be multiplied twice than the money they have placed as bets originally.

Hyuppp!

The kid just now slammed the bucket and was waiting for the betters to make their guesses. After a few minutes of carefully considering which number to bet on, lo and behold, when the dice was finally revealed, three were declared as winners and the rest of the other twenty-two hopefuls had lost.

Hezues nodded. The entire process of the game from start to finish made him grin. He figured out the trick immediately. He knew, that although the kid had to pay the three winners for that round, the other twenty-two who had lost the bet was enough to cover the winnings payout plus profit.

‘Clever kid.’ He chuckled inwardly. That was a subtle but masterful robbery flawlessly executed by a kid. He did something to the dice to turn the outcome into his favor without anyone noticing it. And how the kid executed it? Only Hezues would know.

He gazed up at the clock tower at the center of the piazza. The hands reminded him that it was time for him to get moving. He left the scene leisurely.

As he was traversing the narrow streets of Edgington, he noticed that there were more gondolas than horse carriages in Ale’Xandria. It made terrific sense since the entire city was basically made up of elaborate waterways and complicated canals. How else would one want to navigate around a city suffused with water? Undoubtedly, there was no greater medium of transportation than to travel around the city using the ever-reliable gondola boat. It was simply better in all aspects. Plain and simple.

Literally just ten minutes ago he was at the center of the Commercial District. But now, he was comfortably boarded inside the tiny floating vessel, navigating closer and closer to the army fort with every stroke of the gondolier.

Upon landing at the northwest side of the city, he cautiously navigated his way through the sea of participants before finally arriving at the registrar’s booth. The number of attendees was incredible. And by his estimate alone, there could be more than fifteen thousand participants joining the selection process today.

Over at a corner, hidden within the haystack of people, he noticed a needle. A familiar face. She was still wearing the same ensemble of clothes when he last saw her this morning. With her long wavy blond hair falling gracefully behind her shoulder, Hezues can’t help but be drawn into her direction. He moved a little closer without being too obvious. He wanted to confirm if his eyes weren’t playing tricks on him. ‘Ah. So it was her after all…the maid from the café.’

Hezues had an inkling. He suddenly had a different view of the maiden just now. He had this feeling in his gut that she could be someone really formidable but he couldn’t wrap his head around it. She seemed too fragile and helpless from every angle.

‘But she’s here, right?’

That part left him confused.

And speaking of confused, the kid from Latham Street this morning also showed up. He was having a heated argument against the person in-charge of the registration booth. Something to do with the incomplete documents and late submission.

'A fragile maiden and a thieving kid. This should be interesting.'

But who was he to question their motives for coming here? After all, he was only a lowly dungeon skeleton trying to become an adventurer.

Suddenly, there was a large boom coming from the sound amplifier. The participants instinctively covered their ears when the screeching noise came on. It lasted for a few seconds which annoyed most of them.

After some adjustments by the technical team, the master of ceremony finally came on air again to deliver a very important announcement.

“Attention to all participants. The test will commence at 00:13:00 hours. This will be the only announcement.”
