He had lost count.

Time seemed to have looped eternally. 

He couldn’t remember exactly when it first started. The first time he lurked and lingered under the confines of eternal darkness. It was all a blur now. Was he born out of it? He was not entirely sure. All he knew then when he first sprung out of the void was the feeling of insatiable hunger. It was a mixture of impulse and the uncontrollable desire to kill. 

There was no rhyme or reason to it. He was just that -- a creature of rage.

He could barely recall the first time he swung his rusty dented sword against prey. Or the first time he decapitated someone. Or the time he stabbed someone through the heart. Or through the eyes. Or through some other parts that he could conveniently shove his sword in to. Even the parts the sun doesn't reach.

Did he feel any remorse for slicing up people? No. To start off, he had no conscience to speak of. So it was forthcoming that he'd feel nothing while committing repeated gruesome acts of brutality, day in, day out. What was he supposed to feel?

Between his first fight, his first win and his first loss, he had lost track of it all.

He could not even recall as to how many times he’d died already. The countless times that his body shattered into tiny battered pieces each day, only to be revived on the next. By now, he had gotten accustomed to it -- his own little version of the circle of life and death.

His name? He doesn't remember it either. Wait. That was incorrect. Does he even have a name, to begin with?

Indeed. The life of a lowly skeleton was hard.

It was even harder because as an undead, being all minerals and bones, apparently, you have no will of your own. 

Your body is not yours. Your constitution? Not yours either. There is no freedom at all. What exists are only orders, commands, and that one omnipotent 'whisper' that robs you of yourself. The whisper that robs you of everything.

"Kill them all. Kill them all for Me!"

And just like with his first, he felt the all too familiar hunger yet again.

The skeleton then turned his gaze towards the east. And like a puppet on a string, he mindlessly dragged his feet towards the origin of the smell. The sweet smell of human flesh.

At the entrance of the dungeons' gate, hurried footsteps could be heard from a moderate distance. They made multiple eerie echoes, bouncing off of all of the walls of the great cave. With a loud bang, as the gigantic steel gate was closing, the noise eventually stirred the attention of the other residents of the floor. Vampiric bats disturbed the air and laden with uneasiness, the adventurers scurried their way through the insides of the precipice. 

"I think we should go back. I have a really bad feeling about this." suggested the young man from the back end of the line formation. He was holding a birch staff and was cloaked in crisp white linen armor with trimmings of silver from shoulder to foot. Although he was fairly average in height, Auburn and was wearing a husk type haircut that made him look silly, the young man displayed authority as he spoke. 

"Come on Rye, don’t be such a drag! This is the first floor of the dungeon for fuck's sake. What else could go wrong? I mean, the monsters on this level are all pushovers."

"Will you please stop acting like a paranoid wuss all the time so we can finally grind some levels already? Just imagine, and focus on the threefold experience okay? Isn't that reason enough to take a little risk? And we’re not gonna die okay, captain paranoid. Geez." 

It was Mason. Dressed in ragged brown leather armor, he unsheathed his twin daggers from either side of his waist as he reasoned with Ryes. The assassin in training was trying his best to reassure their captain about their security and that their planned exploits that day would go smoothly. 

"And besides, don’t you trust Edmond at all? He’s pretty skilled you know?" Pointing his left-hand dagger, Mason had thrown his glance over at the tall burly teen who looked very tanky while donning his crude iron-plated armor, helmet, and shield. 

Edmond gave Rye the thumbs up from the frontline of the formation. The team captain was still uneasy about the entire plan but the gesture eased him a little and gave a slight assurance of safety in his mind. 

"Alright. But remember what we have agreed on before coming here. At the first sign of danger we-"

"Yeah, yeah. We bail. Yeah, we know."

"I don’t want to play the annoying upperclassman here, but I just want to make sure that we’re all on the same page. Elsie, have your spell at the ready at all times. The second you see some creature coming our way, cast the spell. You hear?"

"Yes, leader." The petite mage dressed wholly in a black garb gripped her oaken staff tighter and pulled it towards her chest as she responded. Her platinum-toned shoulder length hair bounced as she nodded in acknowledgment. 

Rye was the sort of over-the-top paranoid leader but Elsie understood him perfectly well. She knew where the guy was coming from. She understood exactly why Rye acted like a party pooper all the time. He was simply trying to preserve the lives of his entire team, hence the overprotectiveness.

Their priest's calculated decisions saved them from certain death multiple times already. Therefore, Elsie had nothing to complain about whatsoever regarding the decisions Rye had made even up to this point. If any, she was, in fact, grateful for their captains' actions.

"Illuminate." 

Out of her tiny cusped hands, the mage released a single tiny ball of light which eventually hovered above their heads three seconds later. The ball was the size of an average fist. It levitated approximately seven or eight meters in height from where the mage stood. It was akin to a floating lamp, however, mobile. 

The range of illumination wasn’t too shabby either. Its area of effect was enough for the entire team to see almost ten meters ahead of their chosen direction. It was very helpful for spotting enemies from afar especially when inside the dark and gloomy confines of the dungeon. 

Sight was key. A key to survival. Every adventurer, newbie or not, knew that.

An hour and forty minutes in on the journey, it seemed as if everything was going according to the plan. No hiccups so far until-

"Halt!"

The warning came from Arnulfo, the squad’s archer. "I think I've heard something. No one dares to fucking move or breathe, okay!?"

The archer quickly fell to his knees. In between nearly kissing the dirt and trying to feel the vibration of the earth with his left ear, Arnulfo assessed the incoming danger.

"60 meters ahead and approaching fast. Twenty pairs of footsteps." The archer was on his feet half a second later. His recommendation came swiftly. "It’s a funeral parade, Captain. I think we should leave. Now!" 

Arnulfo had a valid cause to sport such a worried face. The roaming cluster of armed skeletons, or 'funeral parade' as they were popularly called around these parts, was nothing to joke about. There was a good reason why they called this dungeon 'the novice killer'. 

"Oh come on! We've just gotten started. So far we've killed more than thirty level one skeletons on our way here. Twenty shouldn't be a big deal. They’re all level ones anyway."

"And look here, I mean all five of us are level six already, right? It can’t be that hard to destroy them." reasoned Mason.

He was frustrated with the team’s lack of guts to gamble. He just thought that it would be a waste of their effort to come all the way here and leave just barely two hours after they came in. Their experience gained at this point would not even be enough to compensate for their trouble. Not to mention their preparations.

"Did you suddenly forget where we are right now? We're inside the dungeon. And, unlike outside, the mobs here are three times as strong."

"Of course I know that, smarty pants."

"Hey! I'm only trying to keep our necks glued to our shoulders here and you know that. Don’t play daredevil now, friend. You're gonna get yourself and everyone else in this party killed. And that's not gonna happen. Not on my watch."

“Oi! On your three o’clock! Watch out!” shouted Edmond.

It all happened too suddenly. Five skeletons sprung out of the dirt beneath them without warning. It was so quick that one of the skeletons almost snatched Elsie’s head right off, were it not for Edmond having light feet and quick reflexes.

Like a bullet in motion, the tank quickly rushed into the scene. He pushed Elsie towards the left side of the formation, successfully cutting off the advance of the enemy. That, all the while blocking off the three rampaging skeletons with his shield at the same time.

“Whoa that was so close!” exclaimed Elsie in shock and disbelief.

“A little help here.” Said Edmond with a frown.

“Say no more.” Although she just recovered from being half shoved down into the dirt, the mage quickly squeezed in a little spell between gasping for air while steadying her grip on the staff and standing up. ”Thousand vines -- Earth Bind!”

Multiple thorny green vines suddenly shot up from the gravel making up the ground of the dungeon. Each tentacle immediately coiled and subjugated the skeleton's movement, rendering the undead creatures immobile.

As if on cue. Edmond retreated backward two steps and prepared his stance. It was time. "Shield Smash!"

With the skeleton's armor weakened by Earth Bind, the mighty blow from the Shield Smash, made the skeletons crumble into pieces like their defenses were nothing.
"Holy Missiles!"

"Shadow Dance!"

Respectively, Rye and Mason each finished off an undead all on their own. They were both panting hard after that surprise bout. 

Rye, Arnulfo, and Elsie gave Mason the look, who knew what they meant right in that instant.

"I know. Lets bail. Dammit!"
 
They didn't have to discuss anything. They'd done this drill hundreds of times before. They knew exactly what the risk would be if they continued to stay. It was never worth the trouble.

And just like that, the squad took off and left the dungeon in a hurry. There was no need to even look back.

At the gate, the moment that they were outside, the squad decided to take a break. Water flasks were opened and rations were distributed. The hurried escape had made them all hungry.

"It's not here." Exclaimed Elsie as she was rummaging through her sling bag.

"What isn't?" Rye followed up.

"The book that we found from the dungeon chest earlier. It's supposed to grant +25 intelligence to the user when consumed. Geez, I must have dropped it while fighting earlier. I am such a clutz!"

"Too bad. You could have easily sold it off for a decent 80 gold minus tax at the auction house."

"Yeah. Damnit. My bad. Those skeletons! Ugh! Oh well... there's no use crying over that now. At least I get to keep my life with me today."

"I agree." Rye smiled. There was nothing more precious than being alive. "Come. Let's finish here so we can start moving again. We have to reach the nearest town before nightfall."

The team nodded in unison.

Back in the dungeon, darkness ruled once again. It was quiet now. There were no adventurers to prey upon.

There, at the center of the concluded battle, a lone skeleton soldier stood on top of the broken remains of his undead comrades. He was immobile. He was silent. But then, something piqued his interest.

There appeared to be a book lying on the gravel. And it emitted a low, pulsating, yellow light.

He was supposed to just stand there and wait for the 'whisper' to issue his next order. But then, something strange happened. All of a sudden, the warm glow of the yellow light seemed to compel him to move on his own volition. And so, as if to rebel against the unknown whisperer, he picked up the book with his two wobbly hands.

"Agathas Grimoire. If used and applied, the grimoire will grant the user an additional +25 stats points on intelligence permanently. The effect is irreversible."

"Would you like to consume Agathas Grimoire? Yes or No?"

He didn't know what kind of demon possessed him to give him the strength to choose on his own. Freedom of choice was something he was not accustomed to.

"You mentally chose yes. Commencing integration of stat points to the target user. Integration starting in five, four, three, two..."

Suddenly, dazzling beams of bright light flew out from the book. It was an explosion of colors shooting out towards every direction imaginable.

As the papers turned page by page in slow motion, the lone skeleton soaked up all of the knowledge and every piece of information the book had to offer. Not a shred was wasted.

For what seemed like an eternity, the lights that illuminated the dungeons first floor in a dazzling display dissolved into nothingness. Standing tall and immobile, the lone skeleton was dumbfounded. 

But what happened next was nothing short of amazing.

"Holy Shit!"

Those were the first words he had spoken on his own, and not his master's.

"Am I finally free?"
