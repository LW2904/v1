Edited - drizz - 1/6/18

There were rumors going around town lately regarding a wandering deviant skeleton soldier loitering around Dungeon Anu'blahc. Witnesses swore to have sighted the peculiar undead scavenging through the remains of the deceased adventurers littered all across the different floors of the dungeon. Some had even insisted that they have sighted the thing salvage some swords and armors down on the fifth floor.

It was beyond odd since all level one through three species grouped up exclusively within the confines of the first floor alone. And so, to witness one being on the fifth floor, or anywhere else on the dungeon, wandering around like a tourist, even gathering tools and weapons for god knows what reason, was beyond anyone’s comprehension.

As if to confirm the rumors being true, reports of oddities and similar sightings continued to pour in daily through the reports desk down at the satellite office of the Adventurers Guild. And as for the way the deviant undead was behaving lately, no one knew exactly what the rationality behind it was. Could it be that the Dungeon Master was losing his grip on his minions? Possibly. Could it be there was really none, to begin with? Or maybe it was just an anomaly acting like an anomaly.

At the least, the dungeon divers who had a firsthand encounter with the so-called deviant vouched that the creature was completely passive and remained placid. It wouldn’t even bother fighting them. It would just stare at the divers for one full minute, quickly lose interest, and then walk away as if they had not crossed each other’s path in the first place.

According to the divers, the creature seemed to be following a routine. After scavenging, the creature would often just find a place to hide, retreating back to the faded black where no adventurer would dare follow.

Additionally, there had been some reports going around in Tir'ad Pass that the deviant had somehow changed its personality overnight. Confirmed or not, the creature has been accused of abducting several stragglers. The reports claimed that the creature already dragged a number of unsuspecting adventurers to a secret location. It would then restrain its victim before ultimately stripping them of all their valuables.

Through all this, the creature stayed true to one of its core behavioral patterns, namely that it never killed or harmed any of the unsuspecting adventurers it temporarily kidnapped.

One source, a friend of a friend of a former captive, swore that the skeleton would simply release the captives back to the same exact spot where they were originally abducted from. After the drop off healers hurrying to rescue the victim would always fear for the worst -- that their would-be patient was dead before they arrived.

However, after a close examination of those who had been returned, not a single scratch or bruise was found on any of the victims. In fact, all were alive and well.

"A minion of darkness that doesn't kill but only steals."

Gordon had not believed the crap people spewed these days, but here he was; blindfolded, while his hands were securely tied behind his back with a sturdy piece of rope. His mouth was gagged while both of his feet were bound.

It appeared to be that he was the latest victim now. So, the joke was on him.

The score so far: “crap people spew around” - One, Gordon - Zero.

Ah, the irony.

"My apologies about all of this. However, I felt the need to have you restrained. You see, I’m not fond of people screaming at me in horror. Especially in close proximity. And these days, it happens an awful lot. It insults me. No. It hurts my feelings, to be quite honest. I mean, it’s not like I have much of a choice that I look the way I look, right?"

Gordon expected it to be a deviant. It was already a given for it to act unusually. But for it to speak and to even converse fluently in the mother tongues of old Tal'amascan Empire, that part baffled him to no end.

You don’t walk around these parts and expect to stumble upon a well-learned undead. It just didn’t make sense.

And what in blazes was that voice?! Seriously?!

It was by far one of the strangest sounds Gordon had ever heard in his entire existence. The creature’s voice somewhat resembled the kind of sound people make when they struggle to breathe underwater.

‘The sound of a drowning man.’, he thought to himself.

It was airy, gurgly and a little bit mechanical. It was weird and creepy, but it was not quite villainy enough to send him crapping in his pants. It put him on edge though, for sure.

“Do you mind if I have a look?” his abductor jested. There was no need for him to protest. It was pointless anyway. All he could do in his misfortune was to groan through his dirty linen filled mouth. The creature was completely free to do whatever it wanted with him.

While he lay there motionless on his side, Gordon felt a cold pressure as it reached for something from the back of his trousers' pocket.

It found his wallet.

And from the way it sounded after, the creature was clearly flipping through his papers and card stacks already.

”Alright, a guild card. Let’s see what we have here. So; name Gordon Flashville; age 19; human and a Courier class. Level 8. Wow! You are strong. Not bad.”

No. Not the card!

It was never in Gordon’s nature to pray. But when he did pray, he meant it. And right now seemed like a perfect time to lift up his heart in prayers to whichever god that could hear him at this point.

Hopefully, by the time this looting was over, the creature wouldn’t be tossing his guild card away in places where he wouldn't be able to find it. If that happened, it would be the death of him.

His worries were not unfounded. Blame it on his obsession to be well-organized, but he decided to deposit all of his mission credits to that one card. He trusted the advertisement too much. The convenience that it promised. And now he was probably screwed.

The dread of having to wait for four cycles in order to even get a card replacement was enough to make him sweat. Not to mention that if he did lose it, he would not be able to eat, pay for lodgings or even do equipment repairs. He would not be allowed to take missions either. He'd be stuck bussing tables for the entire year just so he could survive.

Of course, Gordon didn’t want any of that. But he could only pray for good fortune.

"Fun fact. I’ve learned how to read, speak and write just barely two months ago. Agatha’s Grimoire was truly high in quality. It taught me the basics and more.” Said the skeleton.

Gordon somehow felt that the creature tossed something away.

Was that my card? No!

“Isn't it neat? It's all thanks to that book that we’re having this wonderful conversation right now."

With my mouth gagged? Sure! Lovely. Give me back my card. Put it back you asshole! He moaned in desperation while he trashed his body on the gravel filled dirt.

"You have a very neat looking satchel Sir Gordon Flashville. I am eager to find something useful inside. Would I find something like that here? What do you think?" the skeleton teased.

The creature wasted no time at all as it thoroughly started to rummage through the pile of stuff that Gordon had accumulated over the course of many months doing missions and trafficking items.

Potions, books, talismans, low tier weapons and all sorts of performance enhancing consumables were obsessively packed and stored neatly inside the leather sling bag.

“Whoa! I've never expected it to be this many. How did you even manage to store so many items in here? Are you a sorcerer, Mister Flashville?”

He would have answered the question right away but he remembered the ball of textile stuffing his mouth full.

In a normal setting, he would have explained this to a non-academic, starting with the clarification of the puzzle behind the huge inventory space.

The secret? It was not due to a spell because it was never related to that, to begin with. It was in fact due to the innate characteristic of his unique class.

Gordon was no sorcerer. But being a Courier class adventurer gave him the ability to expand the space within a storage item: say a bag, or a treasure chest, or even drawers and closets. The ability of a courier was more rooted in alchemy or science, but never sorcery.

It was a pretty neat ability quite frankly. And thanks to that ability, he was a highly valued asset sought after by specialized squads and raid teams.

Team leaders would often fight over him, especially during dungeon diving missions where carrying as many supplies as possible was paramount to success and even survival.

With his current level, however, his ability could only store up to thirty items. It would only increase once certain conditions were met after he leveled up. In the future, if the cosmos permitted it, and allowed him to live after this ordeal, Gordon hoped to grow as a traveling battle merchant someday.

But all of his aspirations right now rested upon this weird creature holding him as a captive.

“Ha! I seem to have found something really good!”

The creature excitedly pulled the item out of the bag for what looked to be a large hardbound book. Black leather casing covered the entire front, back, and spine of the item. There were markings in bold red at the front that helped to reveal the title of the tome.

“The Way of Gawain: Volume One.” the creature read the text aloud, while its boney fingers glided through the embossed runes of the cover. That, as he recited each word slowly. “Sounds rich.”

Given their close proximity, Gordon could feel the entire weight of the thick, unclean and uncontrolled energy, seeping out from the creature behind him. He could almost imagine its grotesque smile over its fleshless face. It seems like it had gotten quite excited over seeing the little tome.

So why the hype?

Well, The Way of Gawain: Volume One, was no ordinary book. It was an item that permanently added 15 points of raw strength stat points after consumption. In a world where the slightest difference in strength between two opposing forces could decide over victory and defeat, a boost in a stat, no matter how small, could give a great advantage.

'Lucian is going to be really pissed once he finds out.'

“I know what you were thinking Sir Flashville. Don’t fret, I am not going to wipe you clean. I’ll just take what I need and nothing more. I am magnanimous that way.”

While it bragged about its 'kindness', the creature was poking fun at him, both verbally and literally by using a dull dagger. He could smell the rust from the blade while the thing tested the thickness of his left cheek with it, hovering centimeters away from his nose.

Gordon started sweating profusely at the thought of dying of tetanus of all things. The dagger, he presumed, although lacking its former sharpness, almost pierced his pasty white skin.

The advance made him wince.“Is he truly going to kill me?”

“Rest easy Mister Flashville. Your life isn’t forfeit yet. I was just teasing.” The creature then withdrew the dagger from the pudgy man’s skin, leaving a white impression on his cheek. “Just remember that were if not for me showing you mercy today, you’d be long gone from this world already.”

The creature stood up. It moved a few steps away from Gordon, while it secured the dagger in its scabbard.

“Let me tell you a little secret right now Mister Flashville. Just between you and me. Promise to keep it a secret okay?”

The creature paused and seemed to turn more serious.

“One day, I'm going to exit this place. And when I do, when the right hour comes, I'll summon you. And when I ask for you then you'd best answer me. Do you understand?!”

He was unsure as to how to correctly respond to the question since Gordon was just struck frozen there. The question lingered in his mind long after it was asked. He suddenly realized then that his ordeal with this creature wasn't going to end yet. In fact, it was just about to begin.

“Remember that you owe me your life now, Mister Flashville. Don't even try to run or hide. I'll know where you'll be at all times, trust me. I wouldn't even need eyes to find you just to be clear."

That threat just got real. Like real, serious, real. And did he just place a curse on me?

Gordon felt the creature step back. He could hear him doing something, behind his back.

"I’m going to send you off now."

"Deep breaths, Sir Muffintop. This is going to hurt a little bit.”

And with a wild wallop, Gordon blanked out.








Personal Log No.18




When Agatha’s Grimoire freed my mind about a month and a half ago, there were things that I immediately realized.

One. My autonomy was not absolute.

There were still moments here and there when the will of the whisper would be far stronger than my own. Although it was not as often as once before, there were times where I would completely succumb to my “Master’s” call. The struggle to disobey was proven futile half of the time.

Fortunately, there was a solution. Sort of. Let's call it a way to counter it.

Although the concept was still a theory, I had observed that the whisper’s power had somehow gotten weaker when I started to accumulate more intelligence stat points. I managed to do so by consuming another set of lesser grade books similar, but inferior to, Agatha's.

I needed more tests to properly prove this theory, but since I ran out of books halfway through the experimentation, I was unable to come to a satisfiable conclusion.

Also, consuming grimoires and tomes had its limit. I could only assume that I had reached a level cap, as I was no longer able to acquire more stats points even though I devoured additional books. I could only theorize that a level up had to happen first in order for me to partake for more.

Sadly, I wasted several books before finally noticing this limitation. It was a shame since it wasn't easy scavenging and stealing those books from random adventurers.

Two. I was relatively unique.

Unlike the rest of the creatures in Dungeon Anu'blahc, I was the only one capable of acquiring knowledge and skills from the assortment of grimoires and tomes of this world, that the adventurers so conveniently brought to me.

This information may not be entirely accurate either, but I was able to test this by way of exposing the four other members of my cluster to stimuli -- a.k.a. the Grimoires.

I have named the four subjects as Skeleton Abe, Bob, Culver and Dylan respectively. They were my exhibits A through D.

For starters, I allowed the four to touch and then hold the grimoires over a significant amount of time. After days of testing, however, the result was a disappointment. It was a pity, but not a single subject responded to the stimuli. Thus, for now, I stood alone, still.

Further research and experimentation were required. I could feel it in my gut, that I couldn't be the only one.

Three. Cannibalism was not an option.

A cage, no matter if it was built in gold, was still a cage. And at the end of the day, no one would willingly choose to be a prisoner.

It was the same for me. I am refusing to be held as a prisoner. I'm refusing to be a slave forever.

I needed to get out of this confinement sooner than later.

And if I wanted to get out then I needed to completely resist the call of my master. Which brought me to the idea of point number one.

Theoretically, I just needed to simply advance my level in order to develop a much greater resistance to mind manipulation. If I leveled up then I could most likely acquire more stat points. And with more stat points my ability to resist the call of my would-be Master would linearly increase. 

Based on what I had gathered, adventurers leveled up by accumulating combat experience points. That could be achieved by killing monsters and mobs, be it on the field or in the confines of a dungeon. There were probably other ways, but those were the only ones I observed in the short time after I reached sentience.

So with that information in mind, I tested if that same concept would work in reverse.

Using The Way of Gwain: Volume One, and with great difficulty, I managed to disembowel some adventurers hiding inside the dungeon with huge red X marks on their faces. I had no clue what those were for, but they looked really shady. It was all a waste however since I did not gain any experience points at all. Maybe the system restricted such methods from me.

A few days back, I tested the same method on Skeleton Bob instead of a human.

It was a complete and utter failure as well.

I could not even swing my sword against Bob. Somehow, the System intervened. It was preventing my every attempt to hit the test subject. I assumed that the system could pick up my hostile intent and would interfere right away before I could even begin making my move.

"I am not allowed to kill my own kind" -- was what the System was enforcing. It implied that I was still part of the System and that there were still rules that I had to follow.
This result, in my mind, only solidified the fact that I was still a puppet on a string. And that made me all the more unhappy.

I theorized that the only way for me to break free from these shackles was to evolve. But how would I achieve such a feat?

Evolve or die trying.

Fact: adventurers were the antithesis of monsters.

In theory, if I evolved and became an adventurer, it'd give me the tool to eliminate mobs. And given the ability to eliminate mobs, I could level up. Once I could level up, I could consume more books. And if I were to consume more books, I would be able to increase my intelligence. That higher resistance came with higher intelligence was an established fact, at this point. And If I could resist, I could be free.

Sounded simple enough on paper. But I was betting my entire spine that this plan wouldn’t be that easy.

Tomorrow night, once the monster wave event commences, it will provide me the perfect cover to get out of this place. The Master will lift the restriction of this dungeon, allowing every single monster to raze havoc outside. And that will include me.

For now, I’ll wait.

And hopefully by tomorrow night... my theories will be proven correct.
