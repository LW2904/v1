__A very simple steam chatbot.__

To run this bot you wlil have to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.

1. Clone or manually download this repository.
2. In the repo folder, do `npm install` - this will install all dependencies
3. To run the bot use `node app`

If you are going to run this on a server it'll probably be a good idea to use a process manager like [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2).
